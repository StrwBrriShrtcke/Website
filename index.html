        <div class="tendrilis">Hi,I'm/Jia/Wei</div>
        <p>I graduated polytechnic in 2023 and I'm applying for a degree in Computer Science in 2025.
          To prepare for university, I have been studying Alevel mathematics and praticing my coding skill through
          doing
          Advent of Code and Rosalind.
          In August of 2024, I had my first exposure to coding via Scratch JR and as I continued learning
          more about programming, I realised my passion for coding. With my new found desire to study computer science
          in
          university, I began learning several languages and even attended my first hackathon, all while balancing a
          full-time
          job &#128560;
        </p>

        <p>When I'm not working or coding, like to spend my free time dancing and going to the gym. A fun fact about
          myself is
          that I can do
          1 pull up &#x1F4AA &#x1F60C;

    <h2>Scratch Jr</h2>
    <div class="tendrilis">Scratch/Junior!</div>
    <p>The thing that started it <strong>all</strong>.Initially, I started playing around with Scratch JR out of
      curiosity and a sense of nostalgia. Back in my primary school days, one of the post PSLE activities we indulged in
      was programming in a similar style as Scartch JR. I remember enjoying programming when I first tried it but never
      pursued it further. However in revisiting coding, I realised that I have s strong desire to pursue it. </p>

    <h2>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</h2>
    <div class="tendrilis">SICP/made/me/wanna/vomit/blood</div>
    <p> Learned the basics of functional programming through SICP. I found it to be very difficult at the begining but
      as I
      progressed, I had a better grasp of the concepts.</p>

    <h2>Hacktoberfest</h2>
    <div class="tendrilis">Hacktoberfest!</div>
    <p>I decided to participate in Hacktoberfest to learn how to use github and how to contribute to open source
      projects. I even managed to get all 4 badges!

    <h2>Exercism</h2>
    <div class="tendrilis">Excercism/and/Javascript</div>
    <p> Learned my first programming language through Exercism! Going from SICP to actually coding in Javascript was a
      difficult switch initially but as I continued practicing, I became more familiar and comfortable with Javascript.

    <h2>NUS HacknRoll</h2>
    <div class="tendrilis">NUS/Hacknroll</div>
    <p>Attended my first ever hackathon in January 2025! I started preparing for it in December 2024 by learning how to
      create a Chrome browser extension and learning how to use the API. Along with 3 friends, we created a browser
      extension with me spearheading the front and backend development.The browser extension is a UX testing framework
      for websites, incorporating LLMs and web-scraping. Although this was a stressful experience, I thoroughly enjoyed
      it and am looking forward to participating in more hackathons!</p>
